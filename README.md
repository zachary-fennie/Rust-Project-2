# Python and Rust Command Line Tool
## This project satisfies three assignments. First, a python script that connects to a SQLite database is packaged into a command line tool. Next, the Python command line tool is translated to Rust. Successful performance of the Rust translation will also satisfy all project 2 requirements. Additional materials include a user guide for installation and  a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline that produces a Rust binary as an artifact.

## Structure Python CLT
The `python_library` directory contains `my_tool.py` which contains all the necessary functions including `load` to transform and load local raw data from a `.csv` to a SQLite database, and `crud_query.py` to perform simple SQL operations. The files serve as a template to be customized for your own data project, and `main.py` is used for testing of the complete operations prior to conversion to a command line tool.

## Successful SQL Operations
